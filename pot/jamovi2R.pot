"Per default, Rj uses the R-installation that is included with jamovi. For "
"most circumstances this will be sufficient (not the least because quite a "
"wealth of libraries is included; see above). However, there might be "
"occasions where you would like to use the R-installation on your computer; "
"typically, if you want to use libraries that are not included in jamovi's R-"
"version. To do this, click on the cogwheel symbol in the top-right corner of "
"the Rj-input field. A window opens where you can set whether you would like "
"to use jamovi's R version («jamovi R» in the dropdown box at the bottom) or "
"your system's R version («System R»). Please note that this option this "
"option is not available for certain system-and-R-version-combinations (e.g., "
